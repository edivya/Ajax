# Ajax

## Overview
In this app we will use the jQuery AJAX method to make requests to server-side APIs. Up to this point, the work weâ€™ve done is entirely client-side, that is, our programs are limited to code that is executed, and data that is generated, within the browser. When we manipulate the DOM, using either vanilla JavaScript or jQuery, we are leveraging the DOM API. An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols that allow us to hook into the functionality of another application and use it within our own. The DOM API is an example of a _client_-side API. There are numerous client-side web APIs available to us for extending the functionality of the browser. One such API is XMLHttpRequest. This API allows us to communicate with _server_-side APIs. Companies and organizations that collect and store data often make that data available to web developers to use in their applications. A server-side API is one or more URLs, or endpoints, where we can make requests for data stored on a third-party server.
